## TODO

* email qian@medicalconnections.co.uk about db/server stuff and maybe wado/dicom interface

## JAMIE

* In-browser DICOM viewer -> use Cornerstone, no typings but not the end of the world
    * https://github.com/OHIF/angular2-cornerstone <- rubbish
    * https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers <- possibly ok
    * Not sure if these references are needed: "../node_modules/cornerstone-wado-image-loader/dist/cornerstoneWADOImageLoaderCodecs.min.js" "../node_modules/cornerstone-wado-image-loader/dist/cornerstoneWADOImageLoaderWebWorker.min.js",

## IGNORE FOR NOW

* Rating -> notify author, include in search.
* Mark case as CPD -> continued professional development. export of CPD data to CSV/PDF.
* CPD for authoring -> what is this? same as above but for when people authored.
* Quiz/test mode -> leave this one until later.
* Auto-purging of old cases -> not my problem!
* Search -> search is getting complicated.  need to come up with a better mechanism?

## NOTES

* expected ~4000 (non-concurrent) users max. 
* data will always grow.

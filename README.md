# RCR National Archive 

An ambitious project carried out in collaboration with [The Royal College of Radiologists](www.rcr.ac.uk) to allow radiologists to send DICOM data remotely from any PACS in the UK to a centrally hosted National Image Data Archive. The project has a number of use cases:

* Teaching databases (the core reason)
* Artificial Intelligence data lakes taxonomised by consultant radiologists at the point of submission
* A tool for organising, hosting and administering image data for clinical research trials
